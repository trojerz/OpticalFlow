# OpticalFlow
Lukas-Kanade &amp; Horn-Schunck implementation.

Implementaton of two of the most well known optical flow estimation
methods, the Lucas-Kanade method and the Horn-Schunck method. This implementation uses two functions, that are not included in the repository: gausssmooth performs Gaussian smoothing of an image and gaussderiv computes first
and second Gaussian derivatives of an image.
